# Face Detection from Image using OpenCV 

This project performs *face detection on a static image* using *Haar Cascade Classifier* in OpenCV.

The program detects human faces present in an input image and draws bounding boxes around the detected faces.

---

##  Project Overview
- Detects faces from an image (not live video)
- Uses Haar Cascade XML file for face detection
- Converts image to grayscale for better accuracy
- Draws rectangles around detected faces

---

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Haar Cascade Classifier
- Computer Vision (AI)

---

## 🔹 Files Used
- haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml – pre-trained face detection model
- input_image.jpg – image used for face detection

---

## 🔹 How It Works
1. Reads an input image
2. Converts the image to grayscale
3. Applies Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces
4. Draws bounding boxes around detected faces
5. Displays the output image with detected faces
